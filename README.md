Sugar Listens
============

Speech recognition for the Sugar Learning Platform.

##What is this about?
*Sugar Listens* is a GSoC 2014 project that seeks to provide speech recognition capabilities to Sugar Activity developers.
For more information, please refer to the project [proposal](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Summer_of_Code/2014/Sugar_Listens).

##Thanks
Current implementation is based on the [Pocketsphinx](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/) speech recognition engine, so thanks to the guys at CMU that made this possible.
